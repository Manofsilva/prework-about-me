      <p>I am a lifelong learner. Spreading my wings into new territory by acquiring my new techie skill-set.
        I hold a Masters of Arts degree in Foreign Languages and Literatures, which is a fancier way of saying read books in Spanish.
        Diving head first into anything and everything I need to know about the tech industry to fully immerse myself in the future.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
